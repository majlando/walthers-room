# Project Simplification Plan

## Current Complexity Issues

### 1. Over-engineered Main Component (FlagsApp.ts - 827 lines)
- Handles UI creation, event management, filtering, searching, favorites, comparison
- Complex HTML template strings embedded in TypeScript
- Multiple modals and panels

### 2. Feature Bloat
- **Unnecessary features**: Country comparison modal, favorites panel, theme switching
- **Complex filtering**: Multiple sort options, region filters, search with debouncing
- **Over-detailed cards**: Too many action buttons per country card

### 3. Utility Overhead
- Singleton pattern managers (ThemeManager, FavoritesManager)
- Complex state management for simple operations

## Simplification Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Feature Focus
1. **Keep**: Basic country display, simple search, flag viewing
2. **Remove**: Comparison tool, favorites system, complex filtering
3. **Simplify**: Single modal for country details, basic sorting

### Phase 2: Code Reduction
1. **Split FlagsApp.ts** into smaller components
2. **Use simple functions** instead of class-based managers
3. **Reduce HTML complexity** in card templates
4. **Minimize CSS custom classes**

### Phase 3: Architecture Simplification
1. **Merge similar utilities** (helpers and formatters)
2. **Use browser localStorage directly** instead of wrapper classes
3. **Simplify TypeScript interfaces** to essential fields only
4. **Reduce configuration files** where possible

## Target Metrics
- **Reduce FlagsApp.ts** from 827 lines to ~200 lines
- **Eliminate** 3-4 utility files by merging functionality
- **Simplify UI** by removing 60% of action buttons
- **Reduce bundle size** by removing unused features

## Benefits of Simplification
- Easier to maintain and debug
- Faster load times
- Better performance
- Clearer code structure
- Reduced dependencies
